Notes from class:
look for colinearity
there is a paper on the data

we are looking to use random forest and xgboost

things to do
look for colinearity
standard scale
tune hyperparamters like L1 and L2
percision, recall, acc, F1
how many you get right, test of false positives, f1 is harmonic mean of percision and recall: this looks for balance
