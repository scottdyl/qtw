This prevented the display from being cached,\\nand it meant that you could get back to the full folder display by\\nclicking on the folder lablel.  That doesn't work anymore.  You have\\nto resort to Rescan Folder.  In fact, when you change folders you\\ncontinue to have the Pick results, not the new folder contents.\\nIf you go to a any folder and do Rescan, then it heals itself.\\n--\\nBrent Welch\\nSoftware Architect, Panasas Inc\\nPioneering the World's Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network\\nwww.panasas.com\\nwelch@panasas.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nExmh-workers mailing list\\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\\n\\n\\n   \n",

You need db3 or\\ndb4 development files at least, and once everything installed you\\'ll need\\nto initialize your rpm database.\\n\\nIf you need more help, I suggest you join the rpm-list@redhat.com by\\nsubscribing at https://listman.redhat.com/\\n\\nMatthias\\n\\n-- \\nMatthias Saou                                World Trade Center\\n-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta\\nSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain\\nElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\\n\\n\\n'   \n",

This prevented the display from being cached,\\nand it meant that you could get back to the full folder display by\\nclicking on the folder lablel.  That doesn\\'t work anymore.  You have\\nto resort to Rescan Folder.
